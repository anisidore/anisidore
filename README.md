# Hi, I'm Ani ðŸ‘‹

...Long outcast, to and fro  
Back, at last, in Toronto  
Recast, fast, as a DevOps pro  
Remote, on-call, in teams, solo!  

## Skills...

...Flex these skills, legit, hands-on  
Linux, Bash, Git, Python  
Jenkins, Ansible, Cloud expertise  
Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes!  

## Experience...

...Built Pipelines, for CICD  
Provisioned too, via IaC  
Monitored stacks, like an SRE  
A few more hacks, and done I'll be!   

## TLDR;...

Across the city, evolution  
High-velocity automation!  
Trained, certified, 4 x AWS  
Tested, tried, ignore my flaws!
