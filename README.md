### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ani Isidore...

Long outcast, to and fro
Back, at last, in Toronto
Recast, fast, as a DevOps pro
Remote, on-call, in teams, solo!

## Skills

Flex these skills, legit, hands-on
Linux, Bash, Git, Python
Jenkins, Ansible, Cloud expertise
Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes!

## Experience

Build Pipelines, for CICD
Provision too, via IaC
Monitor stacks, like an SRE
A few more hacks, and that I'll be! 

## ...and More!

Across the city, evolution
High-velocity automation!
Trained, certified, 4 x AWS
Tested, tried, ignore my flaws!
